# Quiz-App
 
Project designed from practice sets from Udacity Android Developers course **"Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program"**.

The goal is to create Android educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice.
<br>I chose **DMV Motocycler test**. App shows random ten questions from `JSON file`.</br>
